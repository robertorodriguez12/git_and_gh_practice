* My favorite vacation experience was this past February/March. My family and I
went on a vacation to Universal Studios in Orlando. We spent five days there and were able to
experience everything for the first time as a family. My kids absolutely loved
Harry Potter world as well as Dr. Seus land. I personally enjoyed the rides in Harry Potter
world as well, but also the rides in Jurassic Park land. City walk was a lot of fun as well.

* After our five days in Universal, we flew to Cuba to visit my wife's family. That was an
entirely new experience. You hear so many stories about life in Cuba and how the government
runs everything, actually seeing it first hand and experiencing it was amazing. We spent time in
Habana, Santiago de Cuba and Varadero. Varadero was by far my favorite, maybe it's because we
stayed at an all inclusive resort? But i think it's because the beaches are among the most
beautiful I have ever seen.
